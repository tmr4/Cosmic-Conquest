# Cosmic-Conquest

Rick Carlino lead the effort to bring this game to GForth https://github.com/RickCarlino/Cosmic-Conquest-1982.

I enhanced the game for my own 16 bit cell Forth.  It has the following enhancements:

* Reformatted output to a 80 column by 23 line display with added game information on the left and an enlarged galaxy scan on the right,
* Added a spiral galaxy scan to enhanced real-time play, allowing moves while the scan is in progress,
* Added a "long-range" spiral galaxy scan showing an incomplete view of objects farther away (the dots in the image above),
* Input is no longer case sensitive,
* X or x now quits the game, and,
* Eliminated non-standard words.
